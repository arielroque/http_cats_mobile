## :notebook: Overview

This project has the main objective of building a Flutter application that uses a Clean Architecture and could serve as a template for building new applications. For the application of this project we used the [http.cats](https://http.cat/) website as a basis to create a mobile version with Flutter.

You can see more about Flutter clean Architecture: [ResoCoder](https://github.com/ResoCoder/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course) and [Flutterando](https://github.com/Flutterando/Clean-Dart)

## :pushpin: Goals  
> - Facilitate rapid development of mobile solutions in Flutter    
> - Standardize the development of your applications following the Clean Architecture Standard
> - Include minimal libraries to start your new app


## :bookmark: Requirements
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
